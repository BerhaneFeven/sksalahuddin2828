    List of files to generate.
    One file per line. Each output can be customized with options as a query string.

    Supported query string options:

    - palette:      A preset of color, one of [github, github-dark, github-light]
    - color_snake:  Color of the snake
    - color_dots:   Comma-separated list of dot colors.
                    The first one represents 0 contributions, and then it goes from the lowest to the highest.
                    Exactly 5 colors are expected.
    Example:
      outputs: |
        dark.svg?palette=github-dark&color_snake=blue
        light.svg?color_snake=#7845ab
        ocean.gif?color_snake=orange&color_dots=#bfd6f6,#8dbdff,#64a1f4,#4b91f1,#3c7dd9
